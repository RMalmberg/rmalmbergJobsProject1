Met onze tentoonstellingen, educatieve activiteiten en internetdiensten laten wij een breed publiek kennis maken met de diversiteit van het leven op aarde. In ons nieuwe museum verwachten wij jaarlijks 425.000 bezoekers te ontvangen. Ruim 60.000 hiervan zijn leerlingen uit het basis- en voortgezet onderwijs. Met 9 prachtige tentoonstellingszalen vól met het mooiste uit de natuur, workshopruimtes, leuke winkels, een restaurant en een café. Waar jong en oud kan zien, doen en beleven. Een echte ontmoetingsplek voor iedereen die meer wil ontdekken over de natuur.</p>\n<p>Het belang van (open) data voor onderzoek neemt wereldwijd toe.

Opdrachtgevers van deze projecten zijn Naturalis, maar ook gelieerde organisaties zoals Species 2000, NLBIF en Waarneming.nl.
